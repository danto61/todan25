my goal for last week was to sign up for ijava and do at least 4 problems. However, I couldn't purchase the code because
of the server. So my friend, Huong, advised me to do praticed-it instead. 
My goal for this week is to purchase the code and sign up for iJava whenever the server is up and then maybe try to spend
more than 8 hours to catch up on it.
